# Our Projects

Projects are our values and ideas that are driven by the members of the team and the only things that lives out our legacy. Therefore, our projects plays out a very important key role in the department. We believe that:

> It's better to prove words in practice rather than useless claims.

Whenever you have a burning hot take, prove it with an MVP or PoC which will speak for you. It's easier to believe something working or practical rather than an imagination of yours.

The development of a project is also a process that needs some structuring whereas this document also tries to define it as much as possible.

## Actors

A project can have 2 types of members in it at the same time:

### Maintainer

Maintainer is a person that takes responsibility for the project and its development. Therefore, any contribution submitted to the repository or any artifacts of the project must undergo a review by the maintainer of the project. Any structural planning / changes or proposals is also done or to be commited by the maintianer and which also, is subjected to critics or debates from hackers side, not only Leads. Maintainers must be open for any kind of feedbacks from any part of the community and they must accept it postively, because it takes some time, effort and deep experience to provide constructive arguments from hackers side as well. Only if hackers are being arrogant or an asshole, maintainers can simply ignore them to sustain their very own healthy mentals, because **maintainers' lives matter more than hackers at the end of the day**. To put it in simply words, hackers will come and then vanish/go, but maintainers will be here to support a project for a very long time, so they are going to need some nerves to do it.

### Hacker

Hacker is a part of a community/society/departmnet who will pour effort on the ongoing projects to make them perfect. So, if a project is MR labeled, then they do gather their own effort into somewhere as "**commits**" then push it to the project by submitting them as "**PRs**" which will be reviewed by the maintainer of the project whereas in a **ER** labeled projects, hackers have free will to push anything. If hackers are proposing a structural change rather than minor ones, then they shall be prepared for the debate proposed by the maintianer of the project or other hackers to explain & prove anything from their side, because it is a major change that **maintainer** or **an organization** is going to accept it in the first place. Hackers don't take **any responsibility after their PR gets merged to the project** if **it is an MR labeled project** as everything will undergo a careful review by maintainer which means, after a PR is merged, it becomes a burden of maintainer, not hacker's. When it comes to **ER labeled projects**, hackers will still be in charge of their changes even after pushing it to the project.

## Labels

Projects must preserve labels for contributors sake to be able to differentiate or get crucial information from the projects. At the moment, we only have following labels that must be in present for every projects in the organizations:

- **Maintainer Indicator**: a label that is set at the end of every repository's description in `[maintainer=@somebody]` format. If project has multiple maintainers, then every maintainer should be indicated seperatedly with commas "," like `[maintainer=@foo, @bar]`.

## Project types

Project may be different depending on its environment or audience. Currently there are 2 types of projects which are:

### Everyone as Responsible (ER)

If a project has a maintainer label that indicates to @uzinfocom-org or an organization's username, then this project is recognized as "**Everyone as Responsible** or a project where every member of the indicated organization is responsible for the project. In this type of project, everyone is welcomed to push their own changes **without someone's approval**, but be careful as they may face heated debates or need to prove the changes they've done from other hackers' side.

### Maintainer as Responsible (MR)

If a project has a maintainer label that indicates a person or member of an organization, then this project is recognized as **Maintainer as Responsible**, or a project where a concrete person is responsible for a project's development. In this type of project, every change will undergo maintainer's careful review whereas if PR is approved, changes will be altered and burden of the changes will be shifted to maintainers' shoulder.
