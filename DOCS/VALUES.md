# Values

This document defines our values, things that keep us pushing ourselves together as a team towards, things that we appreciate and hold on dear, things that we put our most attention to while engaging any mission, task or project, things that makes us who we are, team "Uzinfocom Open Source".

## Mindset

Most of the time, corporates end up going with the most popular "who's to blame?" mindset which has been preferred by most enterprise companies, small companies, startups, or even some of open source organizations. We decided to reject this practice in favor of our own proposed mindset.

### Why?

We believe that mistakes are the things that leads us to success. However, there are only a few options you can go with when you discover a mistake:

#### Find who did the mistake

This is the main principle of "who's to blame?" mindset. This has been efficient to drive a beurocratic system which drives fear and anxiety through every member of hierarchy and motivate people to avoid mistakes at any cost. However, this is not something that we need, as the resolution of finding person behind a mistake **WILL NOT FUCKING SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS**, because, those 15 minutes, hours or days could have been spent on actually focusing on solving the problem instead of wasting time playing cat'n'mouse which leads us to...

#### Solve the fucking problem

At the end of the day, all we want is to crave for more knowledge and experience which can be obtained only by consuming data, conducting experiments and keep doing mistakes, not intentionally of course. We believe that, only god and any living beings that has no idea on concept of "mistake" is capable of living or existing mistake free. So, chasing something impossible is a waste of time. Instead, we want to let every person in our "family" grow professionally and spend all their energy on self improvement.

**Analogue**: Think of your family and imagine you have a brother who happened to do a mistake by doing X thing. Well, you know that telling about it to your parents will only get punishments for your little brother and of course, this will make the relationship between you and little brother worse and eventually, leading to distrust. In the future, this will contribute to making collaboration harder, which might exceed to being impossible. Instead, you may want to solve the problem without escalating it, reach out for help if it's necessary and close it, let it be an experience for your little brother and move on.

## Family

Every team member is a part of a family, a family that strives to wisdom and putting effort to make lives convenient and problem free (even if it's temporarily). A family where every person supports each other having respect and even feelings towards to members. A family which lets each other grow by doing mistakes and rely on each other in need without being shy or anxious. A family that grows together without letting any member left behind. A family that prefers peace instead of war or drama. A family that's commmited to resolve issues as fast as possible. A family that pushesh each other by motivating to accomplish the greatest.

As you may have mentioned, the statement above contains lines like "without letting any member left behind" which literally means it. If there happens to be a member of a family that has completed his own set of mission or tasks and has spare time left, he should never spare himself from helping other members. Others may join the process and boost the process or provide diverse responses, explanations or experiences.

## The Rules

Concluding all points stated above, we can assume this list of rules that every member should strongly follow:

- Don't waste time finding who did a mistake.
- If you know who did a mistake, don't let ANYONE know that you know it.
- Don't mention the person in the chat, even if it's you.
- As soon as you find out a problem or an issue, immediately focus on solution.
- If you resolved a problem/issue, make a post about it on internal chat providing as much as possible information consisting both about problem and solution altogether but still, without mentioning who did the mistake to share the experience and let teammates grow.
- Use passive voice or, in the worst case scenario, state as if it happened by unknown being while mentioning the details of a problem.

## Final words

```
Hate yourself for being weaker than tomorrow you,
Be proud of yourself for being stronger than yesterday you.
