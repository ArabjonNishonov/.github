# Our Team

This document tries to define every behavior and traits of a member in the department by highlighting the limitations and course of actions to be taken when needed.

## Strategy

We decided to leave traditional and retarded Junior / Middle / Senior structure behind for its outdated approach towards to innovation. The structure of the department follows the `Conditional Team` ideology by treating every person dynamically depending on the situation. The term `Conditional` defines the dynamically shifting responsibility of every member in the `Team`. For example, if the `Lead of Department` is absent and is impossible to contact, then the person standing next to the Lead will take the actions without having to wait the Lead. If even this person is somehow absent and is not possible to contact, then the person who has most expertise in the field of the trouble, problem, task or mission should be shifted to Lead position temporarily to resolve the current ongoing issue or mission. So, every person has ability to become Lead of the Department, Team Lead, Developer, Hacker and Leading Developer **depending on the situation**. However, temporarily shifted power is limited only to the scope of the decision making on current ongoing issue or mission. Temporarily shifted Lead can't change the structure of the department, nor alter changes in rules and principles of the department.

## Structure

Department has only 3 types or stages of responsibility in the department. It was decided to keep the scope less as much as possible to avoid concerns on shifting responsibility and preserve liberalism in terms of decision making.

### Lead Department

This person has every power in the department to alter any kind of changes and propose missions for the members of the department. Also, it worths to mention that the person acting in this position must have or preserve the knowledge / experience on the technologies that are currently being used in department, because dumbass leader without any technical sufficiency making dubmass decisions will doom the department as a whole leading to mass technical debts. Therefore, having only managemental skills is not only enough to replace the current acting Lead Department.

### Assist Lead

The next person to the Lead of the Department to make decisions and take actions. This person at some point shares similarity with the Lead in terms of decision making and must be open for critics, discussions and debates from hackers' side. Following the principles of the `Conditional Team`, this person is the first candidate to temporarily replace the Lead of the Department when necessary. Regardless of the principle, the Assist has power and freedom on making decisions unless Lead itself takes participation in a certain mission and draws strict and concrete line. Also, it is necessary for this person to be highly experienced in terms of technologies and domains used in the department, because dumbass assist may commit war crimes just to silence or get shit done from the back of the Lead surging the amount of technical debts in the department.

### Developer, alternatively Hacker or Maintainer

A master of a certain domain or dungeon. A possible maintainer, responsible person for a mission, or contributor, pariticpant & executor of a mission. If both the Lead and Assist is absent and has no matter of networking, the maintainer of a mission takes the Lead position with a scope limited to only this very same mission temporarily. The maintainer has freedom in terms of making decisions limited only to the scope of the project, but has to acknowledge Lead and Assist posisitions with whatever happening in the project. The contributors are pariticpants of a project that puts their effort on making something perfect, their effort has to be approved by maintainer before it gets merged with the project. The reason why maintainer and contributer treated in the same pedestal is that, a maintainer can be contributor of another projects at the same time. The person has to be jack of all trades, but is not required to be master of all. However, if this person is heading to Lead positions, the person better be master of all.

## Notices

This section contains some of the team's structural red flags to avoid at any cost.

### Boss

Bossy behavior and positions is not tolerated at all. There can be only leaders in the department. If there's going to be positions indicating to traits of a boss, something has gone deeply wrong in the department and now everything is fucked up, the department needs to reconsider application of the moral back from scratch again. The Lead positions are not bosses, because them being acting maintainer or contributor on certain projects sets them apart whereas the only thing that bosses do is to dictate without putting effort onto a mission (actual code or contribution).

### Power tripping

The whole structure and definitions stand to eliminate possible conflicts that may occur in the department. If there's going to be a case where somebody is exercising their power and abusing it to force certain decision, this person must be taken away from maintainer positions demoting to be `only contributor` in the department.

### Masked liberalism

The team strives to be liberal in terms of decision making as much as possible, but if there happens to be a case where a person is force aggro-commenting Lead or Assist's decision, the person has very high chance of getting banned from becoming possible maintainer or Lead. Also, the person might get ignored in further decision making in the worst case scenario forcing to `only contributor` denotions.

### Termination

We try to avoid blaming someone for something and instead, **we are destined to solve problems and let a person grow professionally** instead of mitigating it to waste time and solve nothing. Therefore, it's very less likely that we would terminate someone from the department as every member in the department are investments & assets of the department, but it is worth to mention that termination might happend outside of the department whether people in the charge of positions like HR, CEO or CTO with administrational privileges might terminate someone with corresponding explanations which can't be reversed back or refused.

## Developer hunting

We believe that hunting or picking up right team member is very important in managing a team as it is every member that makes the team perfect. Therefore, we decided to declare every point and good practices while hunting a new member for the team.

### Unique

A new selecting person's main skillset should not have matching skill sets with members already in the team. Revolutionary ideas come from those who think differently, not the same. For example, it is comperatively better to have a person that knows C, another one with C++ and yet another with Rust skillset rather than a group of Laravel retards.

### Open to learn non-stop

A person who has enthusiasm towards to learn new things without ever thinking of stopping and doing a very good burnout management is considered a perfect candidate. Of course, whether a candidate burns out or not is also dependent on the Lead, but if candidate gets to burn out from excessively trying new things, then it's very unlikely that candidate will fearlessly put effort on a product that the team is going to make. Therefore, it is very crucial to check out github of candidates and see how many side projects the candidate has done in past.

### Elasticity

Commercial 9 to 5 retards tend to be very restrictive in terms of project research and rely on the same approach over and over even if it's the worst take. Hence, it is mandatory to ask and also check if a candidate is open for various categories of projects and conduct variety of researches.
